# Website-Build-Using-Reset-Stylesheet

I am testing out a new idea I came across of developingwebpages with a CSS Reset Stylesheet. <br>
Usually certain browser settings will impact your CSS which can cause issues during the development <br>
and design process of a website. What a reset stylesheet does is it sets everything to zero in your <br>
CSS code. Then you will want to put your own CSS code starting at the end of the CSS Reset Sheet<br>

I did not come up with the reset code, I got this off a free online source, I may one day come out, <br>
with my own version. So I would like to give a shout out to Richard Clark for sharing his code! <br>
